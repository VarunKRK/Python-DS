    "**Exercise 6.3:** In the text below, count how often the word \"wood\" occurs (using program code, of course). Capitals and lower case letters may both be used, and you have to consider that the word \"wood\" should be a separate word, and not part of another word. Hint: If you did the exercises from this chapter, you already developed a function that \"cleans\" a text. Combining that function with the `split()` function more or less solves the problem for you."
